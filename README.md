# TOPR-TorchRL

# Env setup

create torchrl environment based on https://github.com/pytorch/rl


# TODOS:

1. Get dataset
  Use SAC to get a bad, medium and good dataset for HalfCheetah. 100k samples?

2. Implement TOPR for RL. Check what adaptations need to be done for RL. discounted reward etc maybe ask chatgpt.

3. Run tests for TOPR, IQL, CQL, TD3+BC
  Track reward, run-time.

4. If successful run on more datasets -> repeat 1&3
5. Paper?

4.2. Can we make it online??
